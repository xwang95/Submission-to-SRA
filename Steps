Submit 16s rRNA data to Genebank with Mothur Protocol

1. The first command you want to run is get.mimarkspackage. The get.mimarkspackage command helps you fill provide all the necessary experimental data about your samples. Here is a link to information about the different mimarks packages, http://www.mothur.org/wiki/MIMarks_Data_Packages.
# I used mothur 1.38.0
# I did the command: mothur > get.mimarkspackage(file=sra.file)
# Format of the file I used (sra.file): 
LA LA_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq LA_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq
# You will get a file named sra.tsv

# You will need to fill in the form. Here is mine:

The file above is the mimark file you will use in step 3

***********************************************************************************

2. Create a project file. You can download a template here.

# Format as below(sra.project):

USERNAME xwang95

Last Wang

First Chloe

EMAIL xwang95@hotmail.com

CENTER ?? University

TYPE Institute

ProjectName Bacterial Microbial Assemblages#######

ProjectTitle Bacterial Microbial Assemblages ####

Description Here we examined microbiota assemblage ####

Grant id=R01##, agency=National Institutes of Health

*********************************************************************

3. Run the make.sra command. This command will parse your sff or fastq file and generate an xml file for submission.

# make.sra(file=sra.file, project=sra.project, mimark=sra.txt)

# 1) You can change sra.tsv to sra.txt, or you can use sra.tsv directly

# 2) The mimark file is the most important part here. Make sure you make it all right.

# 3) For replicate, they must have distinguished features.

********************************************************************************************

4. Email the SRA at NCBI (sra@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to let them know you are making a submission using mothur created files and need an aspera key or ftp instructions. They will provide you with instructions from there.

# From here, you may just send the email and wait.

# I waited for around 36 hours for the reply as below:

Dear Chloe,


Attached is the aspera key and instructions for uploading a Mothur submission. First, I would suggest testing your ascp command line by uploading to the test area. A specific example (Linux) in which "file.fastq" is sent would be:

/opt/aspera/bin/ascp 足-i /full_path_to_file/<name of key file> -QT -l100m 足-k1 -d <path_to_file>/file.fastq asp-mothur@upload.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:submit/Test/username


If the upload to the test area succeeds you can proceed to upload to the Production area. The only change to your command line will be to change "Test" to "Production".

/opt/aspera/bin/ascp -足i /full_path_to_file/<name of key file> -QT -l100m 足-k1 -d <path_to_file>/file.fastq asp-mothur@upload.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:submit/Production/username


There are 3 things that need to be uploaded: the data files, the submission.xml file and an empty file called "submit.ready". This empty file is the trigger to let our processing pipeline know that your submission is ready to be submitted, please upload it
 last. Please do not rename the submission.xml file to a different name. 


You can also submit the required files using FTP(create a directory for your submission in submit/Production/your_username):


Address: ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov 

Username: they will give you a name

Password: a random passcode


If you are accessing the FTP area from command line in order to go into the Production area, please run the command:


cd submit/Production


To create your submission directory run the command (where your_username is the username you login into NIH):


mkdir your_username


To upload the data you would use the put command.


Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions or problems.
